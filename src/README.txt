This is a template to create new Front-End project.
To use you have to copy all files from this folder to your root folder.
Then you have to open root folder in console and run npm i.
There are three mods of work of this template:

npm run dev (development mode)
npm run build (create project (no editing))
npm run zip (the same as build, but creates zip version of project)

!!! This is not the best template. The best is from Patreon Freelancer as Lifestyle.!!!
